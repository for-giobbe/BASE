#Installation and download of the toy dataset:

the toy dataset must be divided into two folders: complete clusters and clusters with missing data

---

#Retrive omega values of a specific branch in complete clusters:

analyze m0 vs m1 - without -d - on just complete clustes
annotate
extract without missing data

---

#Retrive omega values of a specific branch allowing missing data in the group of interest:

analyze m0 vs m2 with missing data
annotate
extract with missing data in the group of interest

---

#Retrive omega values of a specific branch allowing missing data in the group of interest:

analyze m2 vs m2 with different labeling
annotate
extract with missing data only outside the target group

---

#Compare two NSsites model with replicates:

analyze NSsites with replicates
