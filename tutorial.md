# Tutorial

This tutorial has been designed to illustrate several possible use of BASE, which reflect real scenarios ofa analysis.

## Installation and download of the toy dataset:

The toy dataset must be divided into two folders: complete clusters and clusters with missing data

---

## Retrive omega values of a specific branch in complete clusters:

analyze m0 vs m1 - without -d - on just complete clustes
annotate
extract without missing data

---

## Retrive omega values of a branch allowing missing data in the group of interest:

analyze m0 vs m2 with missing data
annotate
extract with missing data in the group of interest

---

## Retrive omega values of a branch allowing missing data in the group of interest:

analyze m2 vs m2 with different labeling
annotate
extract with missing data only outside the target group

---

## Compare NSsites model using replicates:

analyze NSsites with replicates
