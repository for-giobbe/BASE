# Tutorial

This tutorial has been designed to illustrate several possible use of [BASE](https://github.com/for-giobbe/BASE), which reflect real scenarios of analysis.

It's subdivided into four different parts:

* [installing BASE and downloading the toy dataset](https://github.com/for-giobbe/BASE/blob/master/tutorial_1.md)

* [retrive omega values of specific branches of ubiquitous genes OGs](https://github.com/for-giobbe/BASE/blob/master/tutorial_2.md)

* [implementing non-ubiquitous genes OGs in the analysis](https://github.com/for-giobbe/BASE/blob/master/tutorial_3.md)

* [complex models & analyses replicates usage](https://github.com/for-giobbe/BASE/blob/master/tutorial_4.md)
